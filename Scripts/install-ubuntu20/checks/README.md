# Sanity-Checking scripts for Ubuntu
These script, based on Ubuntu 16.04, run various sanity checks against 
the expected configuration for tranSMART installs. Unexpected 
information (such as missing elements) is reported with suggested fixes. 
In any case, for clarification, see the install instructions on the tranSMART wiki:
