\title{
  Authenticate the R client to gain access to tranSMART database
}
\description{
  Function that will redirect the user to an OAuth authentication server to
  acquire a token that grants the client (semi-)permanent access to tranSMART.
}
\usage{
AuthenticateWithTransmart(oauthDomain = "localhost:8080", prefetched.request.token = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{oauthDomain}{The domain of the OAuth server}
  \item{prefetched.request.token}{If a request token has already been obtained, it can be entered here}
}
\details{
  If previous authentication exists, the user will be asked whether it should be overwritten.
}
\value{
  If authentication was succesful, a security token is added to the \emph{transmartClientEnv}
  environment (if non-existent, this environment is created), which will authorize this client to
  access the tranSMART database through the available get methods (eg. \code{getStudies()}).
