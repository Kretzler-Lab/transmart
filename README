The subdirectory transmartRClient contains the R package which allows access to
the tranSMART database via its RESTful API. 

First install Protobuf 2.5 on your machine: https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/downloads/list
You might need to install Curl on your machine as well.

You can install this package by following the instructions in installCommands.R.

The demoCommands.R file contains a short demo of how to connect to tranSMART and how
to retrieve data from it.

The devCommands.R file contains some pointers that might be useful to anyone interested
in developing this package further.
